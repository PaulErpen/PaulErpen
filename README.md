## Hi, I'm Paul ðŸ‘½ðŸ›¸

I am a Data Scientist and Software Developer,
with a deep interest in how computer systems can extend human cognition.
My work focuses on intuitive visualizations of complex data and the automation of challenging processes.

I enjoy crafting visualizations that not only reveal complexity but also communicate it in a way that is meaningful to stakeholders.
Beyond this, I explore interface design to enhance how users interact with and understand information.
Machine learning fascinates me for its ability to uncover hidden patterns that traditional data analysis might miss.

### My projects:
* [CTx Health Tracker](https://github.com/PaulErpen/ctx-fitness-analysis-showcase) - A dashboard and data analysis pipeline for a medical study at MedUni Vienna
* [Gaussian Splatting Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/PaulErpen/eval-viewer) - An evaluation software of Gaussian Splatting models for my masters thesis
* [gsplat-trainer](https://github.com/PaulErpen/gsplat-trainer) - A custom CLI wrapper for the [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat) framework
